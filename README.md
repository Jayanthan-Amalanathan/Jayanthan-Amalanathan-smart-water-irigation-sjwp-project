Abstract

The world population is growing exponentially. 200,000 more people are added to the world food
demand each day. Can the Earth produce enough food to feed 10 billion people? In order to meet
this growing demand, more land will have to be allocated to grow crops and this land will need
more water and it is becoming scarce everywhere in the world. Irrigation uses about 70% of the
total world water consumption. About 250 million hectares are irrigated worldwide today, nearly
five times more than at the beginning of the 20th century.
Irrigation is also responsible for a huge amount of water waste. Even though widely discussed by
most, this scarce resource is frequently wasted about 60 to 70 percentage through inefficiency of
technology used for many agricultural/Industrial practices and many day to day activities of
humans. Hence, water conservation in whatever possible manner is of utmost importance.
Sri Lanka is an agricultural country. Its main goal is to achieve an equitable and sustainable
agricultural development through development and dissemination of improved agriculture
technology. There are efficient ways of water cultivations such as drip irrigation to minimize the
water consumption. But these methodologies are driven by manually set times for watering
irrespective of the need. A better approach would be to water the plant based on the needs of the
plants rather than on set frequency. In addition, there is a requirement for exploring the use of
saline water for agriculture either by selecting suitable plants or by inexpensive treatment or a
combination of both.
And we found an innovative methodology to irrigate the plants by dripping irrigation using saline
water (Sea Water) in an automated way. This innovative research of saving water by introducing a
novel methodology to water the plant depending on ambient soil and temperature conditions is
much effective than other possible irrigating methods. By this method, in addition to the water
conservation, seawater can be used for watering the plant. Also this novel innovation has many
other social, economic and environmental benefits.
